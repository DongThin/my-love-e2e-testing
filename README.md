3. **Testing Libraries**: Explore and master testing libraries like Mocha, NYC, and Chai to write organized, efficient,
   and comprehensive test suites.

4. **Playwright**: Mastering the art of automating web testing across various browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, ensuring the robustness, reliability, and performance of your web applications.

## Training Content

- [ ] **JavaScript Fundamentals**:
    - [ ] Variables and data types: Learn about different variable types in JavaScript such as strings, numbers,
      booleans, arrays, and objects.
    - [ ] Control flow: Understand conditional statements (if/else), loops (for, while), and switch statements.
    - [ ] Functions: Explore function declarations, expressions, parameters, return statements, and scope.
    - [ ] Arrays and objects: Master array manipulation methods, object properties, and methods.
    - [ ] ES6 features: Dive into modern JavaScript syntax including arrow functions, template literals, destructuring,
      and spread/rest operators.
    - [ ] Promises: Understand the concept of Promises in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. Learn how to
      create, consume, and chain Promises for better control flow in asynchronous code.
    - [ ] JavaScript Fetch API: Explore the Fetch API for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. Learn how to use Fetch to
      send requests to servers, handle responses, and work with JSON data.


- [ ] **Git & GitHub Training**:
    - [ ] Basic Git commands: Learn essential Git commands such
      as `init`, `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `branch`, `checkout`, `merge`, and `log`.
    - [ ] Branching and merging: Understand branching strategies, creating branches for new features or bug fixes, and
      merging changes into the main branch.
    - [ ] Collaborative workflow: Practice collaborating with others on GitHub, including forking repositories, creating
      pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts.
    - [ ] Git best practices: Explore best practices for commit messages, branching strategies, and maintaining a clean
      commit history.
    - [ ] GitHub features: Discover GitHub features such as issues, projects, and wikis for effective project management
      and collaboration.


- [ ] **Testing Libraries**:
    - [ ] Mocha: Learn how to set up Mocha test suites, write test cases using various assertion styles, and run tests
      in different environments (e.g., Node.js, browsers).
    - [ ] Chai: Explore Chai's assertion library and learn how to use different assertion styles (expect, should,
      assert) to write expressive and readable tests.
    - [ ] NYC (Istanbul): Understand code coverage concepts and learn how to use NYC to measure and report code
      coverage.
    - [ ] Test organization: Practice organizing tests into logical suites, writing setup and teardown code, and
      handling asynchronous operations in tests.
    - [ ] Mocking and stubbing: Explore techniques for mocking and stubbing external dependencies and APIs in tests
      using tools like Sinon.js.


- [ ] **Playwright**:
    - [ ] **Introduction to Playwright**: Understand the basics of Playwright, including its purpose, features, and
      advantages for web testing and automation.
    - [ ] **Installation and Setup**: Learn how to install Playwright and set up your project for web automation across
      different browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
    - [ ] **Writing Tests with Playwright**: Dive into writing tests using Playwright's API to interact with web pages,
      simulate user actions, and validate application behavior.
    - [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**: Explore Playwright's capability to perform cross-browser testing, ensuring
      compatibility and consistency across different browsers.
    - [ ] **Handling Asynchronous Operations**: Learn how Playwright handles asynchronous operations efficiently,
      ensuring smooth execution of tests.
    - [ ] **Page Objects Pattern**: Understand and implement the Page Objects pattern with Playwright to write
      maintainable and scalable tests.
    - [ ] **Assertions and Verifications**: Use Playwright to perform assertions and verifications to ensure that web
      applications behave as expected.
    - [ ] **Working with Frames and Pop-ups**: Explore techniques for interacting with iframes, pop-ups, and dialogs
      using Playwright.
    - [ ] **Parallel Execution**: Learn how to execute tests in parallel using Playwright to speed up test execution and
      improve efficiency.
    - [ ] **Integration with Testing Frameworks**: Integrate Playwright with popular testing frameworks like Mocha or
      Jest to organize and run tests effectively.
    - [ ] **Continuous Integration**: Set up Playwright tests in a continuous integration environment to automate
      testing as part of the development workflow.
    - [ ] **Best Practices and Tips**: Discover best practices and tips for writing robust, maintainable, and efficient
